//The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

//1^2+2^2+...+10^2=385
//The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

//(1+2+...+10)^2=55^2=3025
//Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025âˆ’385=2640.

//Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
